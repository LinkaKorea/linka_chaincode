# Linka SmartContract
This project is an Active Linka Project.

Financial services are still inconvenient, difficult, and expensive. Blockchain is also difficult and complex for the general public to use.
To solve financial problems and blockchain difficulties, the LINKA team creates a "Value Gateway Platform" that connects the real world with Crypto Space, enabling more people to enjoy the value of finance and blockchain.

** Simply use DApp with your credit card. **

It is too difficult to pay for DApp with only cryptocurrencies. Easily pay for DApp by your familiar credit card.
Combined payments using membership points, cryptocurrencies, and credit cards are also available.
